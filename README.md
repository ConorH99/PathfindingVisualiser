# PathfindingVisualiser

## Introduction

A visualisation of _Dijkstra's Shortest Path_ algorithm where two directly adjacent squares have less cost than two diagonally adjacent squares

## Requirements
For the best results, make sure _pip_ is up-to-date and that you run the file in a virtual environment. To install pygame, run _pip install -r requirements.txt (Python 2)_ or _pip3 install -r requirements.txt (Python 3)_, whatever pip version you use normally.

## Usage

open the terminal and change into the repository directory. Run the file using _python pathfinding.py_. Then, enter in the start and end co-ordinates and the grid will be shown with the start cell coloured green and end coloured blue. Left-click and drag the mouse to block off certain squares. to run the visualiser, simply press space. Once the algorithm finishes, press space to reset the grid and enter in new coordinates.
